  <p class="blogcontent">It was dark, from the front seat only thing I could see in the headlights was the narrow road with pits and pot holes, blind curves, steep gradients, no street lights in most of the forest area! I reached Manali safe and sound early in the morning. After dealing with the agents I checked in to a hotel for 2N/3D package with food and 2.5 days shared tours for Rs.4000. For the quality of food, room and the tours it doesn't look expensive.
  <br><br>Once up in the mountains, that is at 13,051ft, the view of the surrounding Himalayan mountains is wonderful. The view of Hanuman Tibba is unparalleled. I saw a line of horses and horse-riders. They were charging Rs.600 for 1Km ride up to the snow line on the nearby peak to see the snow or that day few snow flakes!! Alas! Anyways, I didn't take a ride, opted to hike up instead. Initially I felt the altitude but then few stops for few sips of water did the trick. I went up much more than the horses could take. The powdery snow, almost nothing, was around and people were crazy about taking picture in that snow. What would they do if they had seen snow in Alaska? They would take few more pictures! huh? :) When I returned from my hike, the honeymoon couple had finished another round of breakfast and tea. They didn't see the snow!<br><br>Then it was time for some adventure, for some adrenaline rush! Yeah! Paragliding down. yey! The valley looks so very beautiful from top! I envy the birds! I wish they understood the gift of God! Fhew ... I felt so light flying ... my purse too was light when I paid :) Adventure doesn't come for free huh? ... after an hour of glide my stomach was filled with some amount of bile which I had to spill out! By that time the couple had finished another round of eating out! We went to Solang Valley just to stroll ... I didn't have budget for another glide and the couple didn't have the enthusiasm. We returned after sunset all tired ... All the way River Beas looked beautiful and I thought it would be nice to go for a white-water rafting adventure some day!</p>

  <p class="blogcontent">On one side of the highway stands massive and mean looking rocks that threaten to slide on to the road causing havoc. And on the other side is the Beas river with an unrelenting current. The bus had to tread a delicate path between these two stubborn natural obstacles. The life of 25 bus passengers (including mine) was entirely in the hands of the driver and there was no margin for error whatsoever. <br><br>After a twelve hour bus ride from Delhi, I reached the first pit stop of the journey at Bhuntar (Himachal Pradesh). Another four hours on the road and an hour long trek finally led me to the remote village of Tosh, located on the slopes of a mountain. The snow capped mountains high above and the waterfall below made the long and tedious journey to Tosh worthwhile. <br><br>The three Indian travelers I interacted with didn't remember what day or date it was. They had even forgotten when they had arrived in this village nor did they have any clue of their departure date. I was beginning to understand why Tosh is called smokers paradise. People don't come to Tosh for the weekend, they come for weeks that turn to months. Stubbles turn to beards amid the smoke and sound.  I walked down to another cafe, with a torch light in hand, only to find another group of young men smoking up and betting on an IPL match."Can you increase the volume, " I asked. They looked back at me with a bemused expression and went back to watching the game on mute. As a rule, the television is always played on mute. Silence is celebrated with joints and psychedelic music fills the space with noise.A young traveler offered me weed and I declined. "You haven't smoked up. And you don't even want to smoke up?" he said looking astonished.I felt like the world is divided into two kinds of people. Those who live in Tosh and those who don't. The former are comfortably and happily detached from the mainstream. </p>

  <p class="blogcontent"> I hadn’t expected cold weather in Dalhousie in June when everywhere else in the country a strong heat wave was prevailing. It got colder as the bus climbed higher and higher. I started feeling suffocated as the number of standing passengers increased. The bus was stopping at each and every village on the way even though there was no space to stand inside. The doorway was packed with school children.<br><br>I was getting crushed in the corner of the 3-passenger seat in the first row to the right… the guy next to me was thin but the one in the window seat wasn’t … the window, the only source of fresh air was closed…giggling school girls were leaning over my seat!  AlI of a sudden, I was overcome by a strange numb feeling in my body and I had difficulty breathing. I started feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  I immediately told the guy next to me to move ahead in the seat and the other guy to open the window. Seeing my discomfort, the girls had moved away. I took several deep breaths. The fresh air, although cold, soon made me feel better.<br><br>It was 5:30pm when the bus reached Dalhousie bus stand. It was a small place overrun with tourists. To make matters worse, it was a weekend! I had thought of staying at the Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (HPTDC) hotel but there were no rooms available there. Ditto, at three other hotels where I stopped to enquire. The place was swarming with hotels, big and small, but they didn’t have any rooms available. Finally, I got a room at Hotel Dalhousie Heights. It wasn’t worth the expensive tariff which was most definitely inflated due to the acute shortage of hotel rooms everywhere. The bed linen and the towels didn’t smell fresh and there was no English music channel on television!  Thankfully, I had carried a towel with me. I immediately set out to find another hotel  room.  I didn’t like the bus stand area and followed the road uphill that led to Subhash Chowk.</p>
